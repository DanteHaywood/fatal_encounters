Fatal Encounters with law enforcement
The purpose of this project is to explore the Fatal Encounters dataset which is a voluntarily and paid dataset which aggregates fatal encounters with law enforcement. Unfortunately police use of force is not recorded by an authoritative body, so private individuals are doing the work. This repository contains code for an article on my site as well as for the data visualizations. It is contained here in a single page app.
